= Native Image

Distributions of this type provide a platform specific native binary, as a consequence you *must* specify a platform value

== Creating a Distribution

Native image binaries can be created in many ways. Frameworks such as Micronaut, Quarkus, and Helidon provide Maven and
Gradle plugins that can create such binaries.

Alternatively, you may also configure a xref:configuration:assemble/native-image.adoc[] assembler.
