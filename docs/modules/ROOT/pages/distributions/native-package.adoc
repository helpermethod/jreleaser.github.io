= Native Package

Distributions of this type provide a platform specific native installers or packagers. These installers may be created
using the `jpackage` tool available since JDK 16. Supported artifact file extensions are the same as those supported by
the `jpackage` tool, that is:

 * .dmg
 * .pkg
 * .deb
 * .rpm
 * .msi
 * .exe

== Creating a Distribution

We recommend using the `link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/jpackage/packaging-overview.html[jpackage]` tool
create native packages however you may use any other tool that produces a native package.
